Welcome to The Footorials. To compile and run, copy the dlls found in the vendor/sdl2/bin folder to the Debug folder. The executable (The Footorials.exe) needs to have the dlls in the current directory to run.
If you get a huge negative integer exit value, you forgot to put the dlls in the build directory.
